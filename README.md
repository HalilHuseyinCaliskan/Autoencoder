📄 DeepFusionNet – Image Enhancement Autoencoder

A deep-learning based image fusion and enhancement autoencoder designed to improve low-quality images by combining both low-frequency structure and high-frequency detail information.
DeepFusionNet uses a hybrid architecture with encoder–decoder, skip connections, and CBAM attention modules for enhanced feature extraction.
